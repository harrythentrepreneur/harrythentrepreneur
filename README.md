## About

I'm a 21 year old entrepreneur who is playfully experimenting with different things on this beautiful world. Started my journey at 13, failed at 20+ ventures, built the largest video editing gig on Fiverr, and now diving deep into software.

## Current Ventures

### Cognition.cv
*Jun 2025 - Present*

Started with a 14-day challenge to map emotions onto a timeline using Gemini's 1M token context window. Vibe coded the first version in one night, then couldn't stop building. Now creating the personal intelligence platform that reveals who you are through your digital footprint.

- Launched WhatsApp analysis MVP that transforms messages into beautiful life visualizations
