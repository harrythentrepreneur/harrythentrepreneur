  Video Processing

  Q: How long does analysis take?
  Processing time depends on video length. A typical 20-minute match takes approximately 5-10 minutes to analyze.

  Q: Why didn't the AI detect a specific highlight?
  Our AI analyzes gameplay patterns to identify highlights automatically. While highly accurate, it may occasionally miss moments or include less significant plays. We're continuously improving detection accuracy.

  Try re-uploading the video. Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If the problem persists, contact us.
